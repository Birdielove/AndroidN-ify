## Issue guidlines

Hey there! You found a problem with the module and found your way here to report it? Great! But there are some things you have to keep in mind before submitting a new issue:

* **Check for duplicates**. Use the search function to search for keywords matching your issue. If there already is one which sounds similar to your one, please reply there instead of opening a new issue. Only exception are SystemUI crashes as they can be caused by various reasons. If any contributor finds a duplicate (or the same crash) he will close it.

* **Always attach your Xposed log**. If an app crashes though you'll have to add a logcat. Use Google to learn how to capture a logcat.

* If you are using a stable version from the Xposed repository, **install a snapshot build** to see if the issue is already fixed. You can find these snapshot in the readme.

* If the issue is new and not yet fixed in the snapshot builds go ahead and **describe your issue as precise as possible**, add screenshots or videos if necessary.

Note that there is no time limit in which the issue will be adressed. Some get fixed quickly, others take some time. Don't open a new issue because you think we forgot about the old one - we don't "forget" issues.
