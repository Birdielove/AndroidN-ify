# AndroidN-ify
An Xposed module to use features introduced in Android N on Lollipop and Marshmallow devices.


### Translation help

The original English strings can be found here: https://github.com/wasdennnoch/AndroidN-ify/blob/master/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml

If you are familiar with creating pull requests, create a new values folder with the appended country code (for example: `values-de` for German strings), create a `strings.xml` file in there, copy the original strings and translate.
Alternatively you can import the project to Android Studio and use it to translate.
If you don't know how to create pull requests you can also send me the translated file.
While translating **make sure to keep variables like `%1$s`**, otherwise I get build errors.
